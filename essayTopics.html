					<li data-theme="b">Why do you believe Beatty has such an issue with books?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Despite being well versed in literature as proven by often quoting books, Beatty despises books and as represented in his work, does all he can to destroy them and those who try to read.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems through his conversations with Montag that he has an issue with the vast meanings in pieces of literature.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He seems frustrated that so many meanings can be drawn from one story that no two individuals in a group of people can truly get the same message from the same passage of reading.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems through Beatty's personality that he is a very controlling person, however when reading no one is in control of the knowledge from books or literature, they can never fully grasp the subtle meanings in the text and therefore it is hard for him to like a concept that he cannot completely control.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">How is the poem that Montag reads to Mildred and her friends significant to the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag choses to read the poem "Dover Beach" to Mildred and her friends to try to enlighten them on the way he feels about the society he lives in.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the poem the speaker tells about his faith, he explains that previously his faith surrounded him as if he were submerged in an ocean, however more recently it seems faith has abandoned him like the tide rolling out to sea leaving him dry.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag explains that all faith has left the world much like it did the speaker of the poem, and all that is left are the people you are close to.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag tells the group that they must cling together as their is nothing left to hold on to since faith is gone.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though Montag's words make since to most reading the novel, it is hard for the uneducated group of people he is speaking with to grasp. Mildred does not see the meaning in either the poem or what Montag says, instead she is more concerned about the possible discipline he could face for reading.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Her reaction as well as the others further extenuates the argument that Montag makes in that their is no faith left in the society they live in, therefore in a broader sense their is no hope for the future, as no one dares to believe in anything anymore.</li>
