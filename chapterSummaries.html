					<li data-theme="d">Following work one evening Montag walks home and runs into his neighbor Clarisse McClellan</li>

					<li data-theme="c">When Montag returns home he is surprised to find his wife Mildred unconscious and overdosed on sleeping pills</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Frantic, Montag calls the paramedics who come and save her life, the paramedics also remark that situations like this occur quite often</li>

					<li data-theme="d">The following day Mildred continues life completely normal with seemingly no recollection of the previous night</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag heads out for work and on his way has another encounter with Clarisse which she begins to question his happiness and feelings about life again</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag eventually reaches work where he is immediately growled at by the mechanical hound that the firemen use</li>

					<li data-theme="c">One night at work the firemen are called to a house where a woman is suspected of owning books</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Montag takes the opportunity to steal a book from the house and he decides to take it home even though it is illegal</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag returns home and lies in a sleepless state in his bed contemplating his loveless and pathetic relationship</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Mildred informs him that Clarisse was killed four days earlier by a speeding car</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag is very upset by the news and appalled that Mildred had failed to mention this earlier</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The next day the fire chief, Chief Beatty, arrives at the Montag house where he lectures Montag on the importance of living a very structured and homogenous life</li>
					<li data-theme="c">During the meeting with Beatty, Mildred notices the outline of a book under the pillow however she decides not to turn her husband in</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Following Beatty's visit, Mildred questions what would happen if he were caught with a book, she learns that Montag would have 24 hours to come to his senses and destroy it or else face punishment from the other firemen</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Millie is shocked and demands he dispose of them, however as she rants about the dangers of books Montag begins to read</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Sieve and the Sand</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag spends the rest of the rainy afternoon uneasily reading through books while Millie sits idly.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The rest of that day is spent reading by Montag while his wife sits lazily around the house</li>
					<li data-theme="d">That afternoon Montag's reading is interrupted by scratching at the door by the mechanical hound</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The hound has come looking for a reason to cause trouble at the Montag house however leaves without any issue</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Mildred is very worried that they will get caught, however Montag puts her in his place saying that what does it matter, all over the world people are at war and are suffering and their community is centered around leisure and a lack of competence</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag thinks back to a meeting he had with a man named Faber years back</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Faber had been an English professor decades ago and during their encounter it was obvious to Montag that Faber was possessing a book, yet Montag did nothing</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag deliberates with himself what book he will hand over to Captain Beatty in order to avoid trouble and he wonders whether Beatty knows of a specific book he possesses</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He decides that he will seek out Faber to have a copy of the Bible made and then turn that in to Beatty</li>
					<li data-theme="c">On the way to Faber's home Montag takes the subway and thinks to himself about how numb the world had become, he wonders whether he will ever find a real purpose in life</li>
					<li data-theme="d">At Faber's home Faber is at first hesitant to see Montag as he fears it may be a trap however he eventually lets him in</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Faber remarks about how upset he is with himself for never standing up for books when they were initially banned</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Faber tells Montag that books have been banned to more effectively control society as books had increasingly made people more uncomfortable by providing their minds with speculations</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The men discuss ways to return books to society and at first talk about planting books in the homes of firemen around the country in hopes it will spark controversy and a revival of literature</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Faber backs off on that idea as he believes that they should wait till war overruns the society and then start anew</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag asks Faber with guidance so that he will not be caught for possessing books</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The two agree that they will have two way radios so Faber can monitor Montag's situations and tell him how to act</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Montag is disturbed by their seemingly lack of caring</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He begins to engage them with conversation on the war and life</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He learns however that in fact they have no compassion for what should be their loved ones and really only care about themselves and amusement</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag also learns that they even voted for the last president based on looks</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag further causes a commotion in the house by bringing out a poetry book and reading a poem to the women</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Following this Montag prepares to leave for work after stopping to check on his books</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When he checks his hiding place he notices some are missing and that Mildred must have destroyed some</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag is frustrated but must go to work so he asks into the radio how he should act in the fire station</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Montag enters the station and calmly hands over a book to Beatty to be destroyed before playing cards with the other men</li>

					<li data-theme="c">While they are playing cards an alarm interrupts them and they respond to the call</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As they arrive at the house where the call comes from Montag realizes it is his own home</li>
					<li data-theme="c">An alarm comes in, and they go to answer it.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">Montag then makes his escape into the night but not before grabbing the remaining books he had left hidden in his garden</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Montag makes his way towards Faber's home but not before he stops to plant some books in a fellow fireman's home</li>
